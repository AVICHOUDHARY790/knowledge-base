# How to write a how-to guide and get $100 in RunAbove credit!

Help the community benefit from all of RunAbove’s power, and earn RunAbove credit to take your own project even further! The process is quick, easy, and we’re open to your suggestions.

## Who can do this?

Anyone can submit a how-to guide for review via GitHub. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, you can create one for free.

## What can you do?

Diversity is at our core and we’re open to a huge range of subjects. Keep in mind that that RunAbove users are devs or devops, so a how-to guide on making Runabove products work seamlessly with popular technologies/stacks/services would be a perfect angle.

## How can you do it?

Simply fork the user_tutorials project on our GitHub page. Create a new page under /en/posts and using markdown to write your how-to guide. Please refer to the metadata in existing guides so that you add adequate metadata at the beginning of your guide. Feel free to upload any images from the /media_resources folder.

The existing guide categories are development, network, and object storage. If you don’t think your guide falls under any of these, don’t hesitate to suggest a new one - we’ll take it into consideration.

When you’re done, launch a pull request for your fork. Once we’ve received your guide, we will review it against our criteria, and either accept it or reject it. If we reject it or accept it under the condition that you make some modifications, we’ll give you feedback. You’ll hear back from us in about 2 weeks. If we merge your fork, we’ll give you a voucher for $100 for you to use with RunAbove!

Please note that we may not accept your how-to guide if it doesn’t fit our review criteria. Here is a list of some of the main points we’ll take into account:

 * Your guide is written in perfect English, i.e. perfect grammar and short sentences (consider using international English).
 * Any prerequisites for carrying out the steps in the guide are listed in your guide’s intro.
 * Any usage you encourage is completely legal and respects good practices and security standards.
 * Content is your own and doesn’t include any copyrighted content (including images). Your proposal should be exclusively published on our website.

Please also keep in mind that we’re mainly interested in how-to guides on open-source tools and integration with popular tier technologies.

If you want to talk to us about your fork, please get in touch with us on our IRC channel: #runabove on Freenode.
